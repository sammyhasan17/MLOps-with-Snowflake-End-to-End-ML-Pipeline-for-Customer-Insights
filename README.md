## 🔗 Features & Architecture

### 1. Multilingual Review Ingestion
- Pull customer reviews from Snowflake stages
- Parallel processing with **Ray Data**

### 2. AI-Powered Text Analysis
- **Cortex AI** and **Hugging Face BART** for:
  - 🌍 **Sentiment Analysis** (multi-language)
  - 🧠 **Transformer-based Review Classification** (Ray for batch inference)

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- **XGBoost** to predict purchase decisions:
  - Uses review text features, ratings, sentiment, page load times, and more

### 4. Full Snowflake Integration
- **Snowpark**: Unified DataFrame & SQL access
- **Ray**: Distributed model training/inference  
- **Compute Pools**: Python execution at scale  
- **Warehouses**: Scalable SQL queries  
- **Cluster scaling** for fast compute

### 5. Automated MLOps
- **Remote ML jobs** for data and model updates
- **Model Registry** for logging & explainability
- **DAG tasks** for daily retraining, scheduling, and monitoring
